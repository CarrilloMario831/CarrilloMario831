I am Mario Carrillo-Bello, a Senior at Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Science, where I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science.

I am a passionate low-level systems engineer with a deep interest in reverse engineering and threat research. With experience in C, Linux Internals, CUDA/C++, IDA Pro, x86 Assembly, Windows Internals, etc... I thrive on dissecting complex systems and malware to understand their inner workings and uncover vulnerabilities.
